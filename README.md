# SideBarToc

This is a demo project that displays a table of contents in an Angular Material sidenav.  I created this project because I
found lots of examples that displayed page menus in a sidenav, but none that synched to the contents of an individual page.

You can click on an entry in the sidenav to navigate to that location in the contents.

As you scroll to an item in the document the sidenav table of contents will scroll to that item and highlight it.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.21.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
